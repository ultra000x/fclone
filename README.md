##

### Description
**fclone** is a python script designed to hack a random Facebook account that has an easy password. This script was released on 1st January 2024
##

### Installation

  ```command here
  ```

##

### Why No Results?

- Target has a difficult password.
- You don't turn on **"Airplane Mode"** every 500 ids.
- Your IP address is being blocked or spammed.
- The Facebook system is having problems causing no crack results.

### I only get Checkpoints?

- The target you entered has already executed by someone.
- Your provider is not suitable for this script.
- The target you entered is not good or you are unlucky.
