### Why no results?

- Targets has a difficult password.
- You don't turn on **"Airplane Mode"** every 500 ids.
- Your IP address has being blocked or spammed.
- The Facebook system is having problems causing no crack results.

### Why only getting checkpoints ids?

- The target has already executed by someone.
- The target is not good or you are unlucky.
- Your provider is not suitable for this script.
